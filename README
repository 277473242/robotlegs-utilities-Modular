Some helper classes for building modular apps with RobotLegs.

Modules should extend GenericModule.

Each module requires a context, which should extend GenericModuleContext.

The GenericModuleMediator class should not be extended, but can be used as a template for a mediator for your module.

The ModuleCommandMap and ModuleEventDispatcher work together to provide the modules with a shared event/command bus for inter-module events to take place.

Please see the RobotLegs framework for more info.

These classes were compiled to work with RobotLegs v1.0.

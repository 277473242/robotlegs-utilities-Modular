Some helper classes for building modular apps with RobotLegs.

Shells should extend ModuleShellContext.

Modules should extend ModuleContextView.

Each module requires a context, which should extend ModuleContext.

The IModuleCommandMap and IModuleEventDispatcher work together to provide the modules with a shared event/command bus for inter-module events to take place.

Please see the RobotLegs framework for more info.

These classes were compiled to work with RobotLegs v1.0.
